* Most of my time goes into building bridges which connect gobs of data to the real world using neural networks. :bridge_at_night:
* Sometimes those bridges are as overly specific as tracking and terminating animals in Minecraft. :hocho: :chicken: .
* I spend more time with PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas and OpenCV than I do with my friends. :space_invader:

As of late, I've been working with [INCF](https://www.incf.org/), where I'm training various types of deep learning models for [DevoWorm](https://github.com/devoworm). The models range from  segmentation models, LSTMs to the good old CNNs which are used to extract metadata from microscopic images of the C. elegans worm. 

[Bunch](https://github.com/devoworm/GSoC-2020/blob/master/Pre-trained%20Models%20(DevLearning)/README.md) of stuff I've been working on lately.
